.Nm
is a tool for exporting records from Open Directory.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width stringtosetspacing12
.It filePath
is a path to the file to be created and in which the data should be exported to. If the file already exists it will be overwritten.
.It DSNodePath
is the path to the DS node where the records will be read from.
.It recordType
is the type of DS record to be exported from the node. If the record type does not have a 'dsRecTypeStandard:' or a 'dsRecTypeNative:' prefix the tool will search the node to see if the record type is a supported standard attribute and if this is the case it will export those records. If not the record type is considered to be native. Standard Record types are defined in 
.Pa DirServicesConst.h
.It Op -r <recordName>
is a list of the DS recordNames we wish to export from the Node. The names are to be separated by a comma (","). If no record names are specified the tool exports all the records on the specified node. Example: '-r admin, root, user1'
.It Op -e <attributesToBeExcluded>
is a list of attribute types that should not be exported for every record. The attributes types are to be separated by a comma (","). 
.Pp
The following record types are always excluded: 'dsAttrTypeStandard:AppleMetaNodeLocation, dsAttrTypeStandard:RecordType, dsAttrTypeNative:objectClass'
.It Fl -N 
is the flag to tell the tool to export the native attributes as well as the standard attributes. By default the tool only exports standard attributes.
.El
.Sh DSPROXY
This is to be used in order to connect to a proxy machine. All three options are needed. If you do not specify the password as an argument the tool will prompt you for it.
.Bl -tag -width stringtosetspacing12
.It Op -a <proxyAddress>
is the address of the proxy machine the user wishes to use.
.It Op -u <proxyUser> 
Specifies user name to use for the proxy connection
.Pp
.It Op -p <proxyPassword>
Specifies password to use for the proxy connection. For proxy connections name/password are required. If the this option is not specified and the user has specified a proxy machine and username the tool will prompt the user for the password.
.El
.Sh NOTES
When using an LDAP node please be aware that this tool can only export as many records as the LDAP server is willing to return. This means that if you have several thousand users you might want to raise the maximum number of search results that the server returns. This can be done in Server Admin (my.server.com>OpenDirectory>Settings> Protocols tab). By default this is set to 11000 results.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Export all userRecords from the local node to export.out: 
.Pp
.Dl $ dsexport export.out /Local/Default dsRecTypeStandard:Users
.Pp
Export the group records for admin and staff from the LDAPv3 Node on a proxy machine 'proxy.machine.com': 
.Pp
.Dl $ dsexport export.out /LDAPv3/127.0.0.1 dsRecTypeStandard:Groups -r admin, staff -a proxy.machine.com -u diradmin -p pass
